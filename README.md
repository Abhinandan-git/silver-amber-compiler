# silver-compiler
A sample compiler written in C.

The language will be called FFO-Lang.
It is an abbreviation to Full-Form Oriented Language.
This is named so because the developer likes to write the literals and variable names in full names instead of giving abbreviations to the names, so as to remove the confusion later whenever proof-reading.
